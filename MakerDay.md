# Maker Day Plan:

1. Generate a new tinkercad.com classroom user:
  * Add said user to class, and make it's nickname: "makerday"
2. Make sure there are at least 10 laptops for kids to use ( for littles )
3. Limit how many kids can be in the classroom at one time + limit time
4. Only print things that they make, not things that they 'pick'
5. At the end of the allowed time, if the child wants add them to a MakerDay classroom, with a passcode + new nickname for them to use.
  * Prepare pre-made printouts, to fill out for the child.
6.
